Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀  
Here you’ll find my projects, exercises and experiments as I grow as a **Fullstack Developer**.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
- 🌱 I’m a **self-taught developer** passionate about creating tools that improve user experience and help me understand how technology works.  
- 🎯 Currently focused on **Java (Spring Boot), React, TypeScript and MySQL**, while also learning about **Testing (JUnit, TDD)** and **cloud basics (AWS)**.  
- 💼 Before IT, I worked for 8+ years as a **sports coordinator & supervisor**, leading teams of up to 70 people. This gave me strong skills in **leadership, project management and teamwork** that I now bring to software development.  
- 📚 I believe in continuous learning and love turning challenges into opportunities to grow.
