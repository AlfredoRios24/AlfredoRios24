## Hello I'm Alfredo RÃ­os!! 
Welcome to my litle space in GitHub!!ðŸ‘‹

About me

I've made the decision to move into programming because I've discovered, among other things, that I can create different tools that can help improve the user experience and at the same time help me understand how things work.

I consider myself a self-taught person, in which I always try to adapt myself to the different situations that arise, assuming them as a challenge and as a problem to be solved.

Although I have no work experience in programming, I have more than 8 years of experience as a coordinator and supervisor of sports centres. This experience has also given me an ability to organise teams and work with delivery targets
